# SpringBoot
In this repository I'll made the steps of the "[Learn Spring Boot in 100 Steps - Beginner to Expert](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-spring-boot-100-steps-beginner-expert-video)" course.

In the course is used Eclipse, instead I'll use IntelliJ IDEA, so I'll annotate how some stuff are made with this IDE.

The course uses Spring Boot 1.4.3, instead I'll have to use 2Spring Boot 2.1.0, so I'll annotate the differences when needed.

The repository is divided by the main topics and each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons. Each step contains a readme with the step explanation of the step and, if is change from the previous step, the new code.
