# SpringBoot Tutorials

In this repository I'll follow the steps of three video courses:
- [Learn Spring Boot in 100 Steps - Beginner to Expert](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-spring-boot-100-steps-beginner-expert-video)
- [Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/master-microservices-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud-video)
- [Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/master-java-web-services-and-rest-api-spring-boot-video)

Each Course is divided by the main topics and each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons. Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and, if is change from the previous step, the new code.

Since the courses belong to the same teacher, some topics overlap, for this reason I'll divide the repository by topics, not by courses.

copy and paste the identical part and add the differences (if present).

The courses use different versions of Spring Boot, instead I'll use Spring Boot 2.1.x, so I'll annotate the differences when needed.

In the courses is used Eclipse, instead I'll use IntelliJ IDEA, so I'll annotate how some stuff are made with this IDE.
