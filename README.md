# SpringBoot Tutorials
In this repository I'll follow the steps of three video courses:
- [Learn Spring Boot in 100 Steps - Beginner to Expert](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learn-spring-boot-100-steps-beginner-expert-video) (Spring Boot)
- [Master Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/master-microservices-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud-video) (Spring Microservices)
- [Master Java Web Services and REST API with Spring Boot](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/master-java-web-services-and-rest-api-spring-boot-video) (Spring REST)

In the courses is used Eclipse, instead I'll use IntelliJ IDEA, so I'll annotate how some stuff are made with this IDE.

The courses use different versions of Spring Boot, instead I'll use Spring Boot 2.1.x, so I'll annotate the differences when needed.

Each Course is divided by the main topics and each one is divided by the different course steps/lessons. Each step contains a readme with the explanation of the step and, if is change from the previous step, the new code.

Because of some topics overlap I'll copy and paste the identical part and add the differences (if present).
